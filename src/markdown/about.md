Law student turned software engineer ([wait what?!](https://medium.com/@fabianterh/celebrating-1-year-as-a-software-engineer-e21148e307c0)).
From Singapore, but currently based in Silicon Valley.
In my free time, I hack on side projects, fight gravity on rock walls, or am adventuring in the mountains.
Other hobbies include brewing pourover coffee, reading, and enjoying craft beers.
