These are some of my work that I'm most proud of:

- [**How to improve your data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving skills**](https://medium.com/p/how-to-improve-your-data-structures-algorithms-and-problem-solving-skills-af50971cba60)\
  My post popular post, with over 149K views. I wrote this while learning data structures and algorithms to prepare myself for technical interviews.

- [**Heimdall, an open-source email guardian hosted on AWS**](https://github.com/fterh/heimdall)\
  Generates and manages replyable email aliases. Featured on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22210782). I also wrote about it [here](https://medium.com/swlh/how-i-built-heimdall-an-open-source-personal-email-guardian-68e306d172d1).

- [**Github: /fterh/leetcode-curation-topical**](https://github.com/fterh/leetcode-curation-topical)\
  A curation of Leetcode questions which I used to prepare for my technical interviews (it got me a job at Facebook!)

- [**sneakpeek, a _good bot_ on Reddit**](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)\
  I built this to fetch news articles and post them as comments on _/r/Singapore_. Check it out in action [here](https://reddit.com/u/sneakpeek_bot).
